# Buy Menu Icon Replacements
This is a mod for Gmod TTT that changes the style of buy menu icons to be more consistent and categorised.

Tried of buy menu icons being inconsistent and all over the place?
Want icons to be colour-coded?
Want to change the icons in the buy menu yourself?

Then try out this mod!

This changes all the icons in the buy menu to show what type of weapon you are buying at a glance by colour-coding.
(But there's also an option in the F1 settings tab to change back to vanilla TTT style if you want!)
This setting is per-player too, so everyone can set how their icons look as they like.
All icons are colour-coded by default, with a symbol in the bottom right hinting at what the colour represents.

Also, this mod is completely client-side, meaning you can use it without the server you're playing on needing to have the mod installed.

You can also make your own packs of icons in your own mod!
Install this mod, and then put all the icons you want inside materials/vgui/ttt/shop-icon-replacements/[MYICONFOLDER]
The name of each icon should be either the classname of the item, or ID if it's a passive item, see this mod's icon files for an example.
